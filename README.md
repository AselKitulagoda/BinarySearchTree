# BinarySearchTree

### About
* Bsearch is a tree module in C that allows the user to do a binary search for a number in a tree, insert nodes and trees, reverse the tree aswell find the maximum height of any tree.
* Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
    * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    * The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.


### Pre-requisities 
* You need to have ***GCC*** installed from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/).

### How to Run
* Go to the root folder and execute the command : ```make -B```.
* This will run all the tests inside [bsearch.c](bsearch.c) and will indicate if ```all tests are passed```.

### Testing 
* This application includes 4 tests for ```Insert```, ```Lookup```, ```Reverse``` and ```MaxHeight```.
* Once you run the application all tests should automatically be run.
